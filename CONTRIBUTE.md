## Guidance

### Add new dataset

Currently, we only provide the downloading interface for the website http://base.ustc.edu.cn/data/.

If you try to add a new dataset, you should first upload the dataset to the website, and then complete two things:

* create the key-value pair in `URL_DICT` of [`download_data.py`](Edudata/Dataset/download/data/download_data.py)
* run `pytest` to test whether all test cases go well
